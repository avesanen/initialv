To help networking not fall out of sync, let's implement all game objects to
have these properties.

    Position:
        -x   horizontal position (pixels)
        -y   vertical position (pixels)
        -a   angle (degrees)

    Velocity
        -dx  horizontal velocity (pixels/second)
        -dy  horizontal velocity (pixels/second)
        -da  angle velocity (degrees/second)

    Acceleration
        -ddx horizontal acceleration (pixels/second^2)
        -ddy vertical acceleration (pixels/second^2)
        -dda angle acceleration (degrees/second^2)



A list of features not yet implemented, but would be nice some day:

[ ] plasma clouds, nebulas or generally stuff on the map where you can hide. new canvas?
[x] bullets will hit own ship and other ships -> hitpoints, death
[ ] respawn and lives?
[x] docks on the ground, where ship can be recharged
[x] special weapon in another key, for example a bomb that splits to many bullets
[ ] return of the network game
[ ] design some way for players to choose map, start game and the game to end
    Choice 1: one player chooses "host game", gets url to clipboard. when pasted in chats to other players,
    they can join that game with that url till host launches it
    Choice 2: a full blown lobby, like in some other games
[ ] use json for defining map, sprites and sound lists
[ ] a loading screen which goes off only when all images and sounds are loaded
